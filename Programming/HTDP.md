# How to Design Programs (Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi)
This book by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi is freely available [online](https://htdp.org/2023-8-14/Book/index.html).

Like [SICP](SICP.md), it uses a derivative of Scheme---several, in fact, and you'll *need* [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org) for this book.
