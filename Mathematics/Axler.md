# Linear Algebra Done Right
Proof-based linear algebra book by Sheldon Axler. This is more oriented toward a second course, but can be studied without background in linear algebra if you're up for the challenge. The "done right" refers to how the book avoids using determinants in proofs until the end of the book, as that allows for more insightful proofs in many cases.
