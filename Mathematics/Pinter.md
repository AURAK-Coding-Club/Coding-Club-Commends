# A Book of Abstract Algebra
A relaxed introduction to undergraduate-level abstract algebra by Charles Pinter. It covers the basics of group theory, ring and field theory, and a bit of Galois theory. Some applications to other fields are discussed, like to the theory of computation. A couple of chapters also briefly develop number theory and linear algebra based on the rest of the material.

Some major concepts and results are left as exercises, albeit guided ones with multiple parts.
