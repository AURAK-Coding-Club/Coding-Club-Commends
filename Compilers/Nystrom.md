# Crafting Interpreters

An accessible book, written in a conversational tone. This book implements two interpreters, one in Java and the other in C. The first implementation is focused on basic concepts, while the second uses more advanced data structures and so on to have better performance.

It's suggested by many readers that you implement the interpreters in languages other than Java or C.
