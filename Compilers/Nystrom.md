## Description

An accessible book, written in a conversational tone with some illustrations and jokes. This book implements two interpreters, one in Java and the other in C. The first implementation is focused on basic concepts, while the second uses more advanced data structures and so on to have better performance.

It's suggested by many readers online that you implement the interpreters in languages other than Java or C. This will force you to thoroughly understand what the author's code is doing, and learn how to perform the same tasks in a different language.

The prerequisites to studying this book are knowing some Java and C, and some basic data structures.
