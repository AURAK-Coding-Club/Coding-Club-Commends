## Description

The standard compilers textbook, going over foundational material in compiler design and implementation. There's plenty of advanced topics as well, at the graduate level, but nothing "new". This book also explains some of the CS theory relevant to writing compilers.

Familiarity with programming concepts, data structures and algorithms, and some discrete mathematics.

A supplementary website for the book can be found at [](https://suif.stanford.edu/dragonbook/). This website includes lecture notes and handouts from several courses that use the book, as well as a list of errata, and a tar file containing the source code for the Java program in Appendix A.
