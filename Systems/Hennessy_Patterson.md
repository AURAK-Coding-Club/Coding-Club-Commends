# Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach
A more advanced book by Hennessy and Patterson on computer architecture, focusing on quantitative, real-world measurements of the performance, throughput, and so on of different approaches to computer architecture. There is heavy emphasis on parallelism at every stage.

This book is not at an introductory level. The prerequisites are outlined in appendices A through C (on ISA principles, the memory hierarchy, and pipelining), but those are written with the intent of being a review, so a dedicated book would be more appropriate. The authors' [other book](Patterson_Hennessy) fits that purpose.

Most of this book's appendices (from D to M) are online-only, and are available for free at [this webpage](https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/book-companion/9780128119051). Together they amount to about 650 pages' worth of material, while the printed book is around 850 pages.
