# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
By Bryant and O'Hallaron, this book provides a coverage of many systems concepts that a thoroughly competent programmer ought to know, with a focus on how to apply them effectively. For the most part, this book uses the C language, with some x86-64 whenever machine-level code is relevant.
