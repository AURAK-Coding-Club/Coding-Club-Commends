# The Elements of Computing Systems
This book, by Nisan and Schocken, starts from the hardware level with logic gates and builds up to a fully working operating system and high level programming language. That means that it's a good starting point for developing a working understanding of a computer from top to bottom, after which you can move on to more dedicated books on each topic.

The book is nicknamed Nand2Tetris since you start with just NAND gates and make everything else from those, up to the point where you can program a game like Tetris without significant effort. 

There is a supplementary website [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org). The "Projects" page lists all the projects and the resources you need to build them, and has free PDFs of the first six chapters.
