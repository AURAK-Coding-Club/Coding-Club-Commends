# Computer Organization and Design
A book by Hennessy and Patterson detailing computer organization, and how computer hardware operates.

Compared to the [other book](Hennessy_Patterson.md) by the same authors, this one is not targeted at computer hardware designers, and is at a somewhat less advanced level of study.

For the most part, this book uses the older MIPS architecture to illustrate major concepts, due to its relative simplicity. However, other architectures are covered on occasion to provide more relevant information.
