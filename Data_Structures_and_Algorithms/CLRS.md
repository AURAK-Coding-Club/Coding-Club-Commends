## Introduction to Algorithms
The classic textbook and reference by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. It's a little heavy on the math, but doesn't require any advanced background; elementary calculus is plenty.

Additional resources are [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/), under the "Resources" tab. Notably, there is some material provided free of charge that was in the third edition, but isn't included in the fourth.
