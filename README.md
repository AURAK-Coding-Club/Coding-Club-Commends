# Coding Club Commends

This repository is a collection of recommended books and resources of all kinds, on computer science, programming, and related topics, put together by the AURAK Coding Club.

The structure of this repo is as follows. 
- Each resource has a dedicated Markdown document (.md), which gives a brief introduction of that resource. 
- In addition, the document may provide additional links helpful in using the resource, or commentary and tips from those who have used it. 
- The documents are organized into the directories in this repository, according to the topic or subject that they are about.
- Each topic's directory also contains a README file, which acts as a "map" to help you find your way around the resources surrounding that specific topic.
- The present document also acts as a map, in navigating the topics themselves.

## Subjects

- [Programming](Programming/README.md)
- [Compilers](Compilers/README.md)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/README.md)
- [Mathematics](Mathematics/README.md)
- [Theory of Computation](Theory_of_Computation/README.md)
- [Systems](Systems/README.md)
