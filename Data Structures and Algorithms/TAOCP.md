# The Art of Computer Programming (Knuth)
A multi-volume, work-in-progress series on algorithms and their analysis, by Donald Knuth.

Section 1.2 covers the mathematical background needed to make sense of the analyses done in the series. The book [Concrete Mathematics](../Mathematics/Concrete Mathematics.md) expands on this exposition in textbook form.

Sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2, and 1.4.1 through 1.4.3 introduce an outdated fictional assembly language MIX. 
The [MMIX Fascicle](https://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/fasc1.pdf) replaces these sections, introducing MMIX instead, which more accurately reflects the behavior of modern processors.

All programs in Volumes 1--3 are written in MIX.
The [MMIX Supplement](https://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu/supplement/index.html) by Martin Ruckert replaces these programs, and some parts of the main text.
