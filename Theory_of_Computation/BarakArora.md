## Description

A book on computational complexity by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak. It's between the introductory graduate level and advanced undergraduate level.

The book technically assumes no prerequisites in theoretical computer science (although some familiarity would be helpful; see [this book](Sipser.md)). However, it requires plenty of mathematical background. Primarily, this is in basic discrete mathematics and probability theory, but due to the book's wide coverage of "exotic" complexity classes, some knowledge of finite fields and groups, vector spaces and Hilbert spaces, and polynomials is required. The main results are reviewed in Appendix A.
