## Description

An undergraduate-level book by Michael Sipser, covering major results from the theories of automata, computability, and complexity. The few prerequisites are reviewed at the very beginning of the book.

The book requires only basic familiarity with discrete mathematics, and reviews all of the necessary concepts in Chapter 0.
